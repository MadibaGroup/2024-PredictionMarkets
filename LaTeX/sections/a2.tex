\section{List of \depms}
\label{app:list}

 %Terminology used includes a central limit order book (CLOB) in which `central' refers to a single orderbook rather than one that is centralized from an operational standpoint. In other words, a decentralized on-chain orderbook can still be called a CLOB. Blockchains are sometimes called layer 1 (L1) chains. An L2 is a faster execution (and generally lower fee) layer that might operate as an optimistic rollup or zk-rollup. An L3...

\end{figure}

\section{Example instantiation of definition}
\label{app:example}

In section~\ref{sec:hbo}, we discussed an example market concerning who the HBO documentary `Money Electric' would name as Satoshi Nakamoto. In this section, we will see how this fits the definitions of a market, prediction market system, and the Arrow--Debreau special case. As discussed in Section~\ref{wf:mech}, Polymarket employs a market mechanism we call a yes/no bundle (YNB), as opposed to winner-take-all (WTA). YNB requires an extra step in the definitions so we will do a first pass with a simplified WTA submarket, and then add the full YNB market.

\subsection{Pass 1: Single WTA Market}

Consider a simplified market that questions whether one specific candidate, \eg Hal Finney, is named as Satoshi: yes or no. If through unforeseen circumstances, who the documentary names is not verifiable by the air date, the market resolves to no.

Recall Definition~\ref{def:market} of a market: 

\begin{definition}[Market]
A (single) market is a tuple $M=(E,\Omega,J,R)$, where $E$ is a well-defined uncertain event, $\Omega$ is a nonempty outcome space for $E$, $J$ is a finite index set of contract labels (“shares”), and $R=(R_j)_{j\in J}$ are nonnegative payoff functions with $R_j:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. 
We assume $|J|\ge|\Omega|$ and we require \emph{outcome distinguishability} on $\Omega$:
\[
\forall\,\omega\neq\omega'\in\Omega\ \ \exists\,j\in J:\ R_j(\omega)\neq R_j(\omega').
\]
When $M$ resolves to $\omega_M\in\Omega$, one unit of share $j\in J$ pays $R_j(\omega_M)$ (in units of $\mathcal{N}$ defined below).
\end{definition}

Event $E$ is whether or not Hal Finney is named as Satoshi in the documentary.

$\Omega$ is the set of resolution outcomes the market recognizes for $E$, the labels the system can publish at settlement. For this Hal-only binary market the outcome space is $\Omega=\{\mathsf{True},\mathsf{False}\}$. Here $\mathsf{True}$ means the documentary (per the market’s stated criteria) identifies Hal Finney as Satoshi; $\mathsf{False}$ aggregates all other possibilities (Hal not named, someone else named, no one named, the film does not air, or the identification is not verifiable by the resolution deadline).

%Once some $\omega\in\Omega$ is published, all payoffs $R_j(\omega)$ are determined.

We require that $\Omega$ contain no redundant labels. A label is redundant if it does not change at least one contract’s payoff: $\omega\sim\omega' \iff \forall j\in J,\ R_j(\omega)=R_j(\omega')$. For example, “Hal is named and it is raining’’ and “Hal is named and it is not raining’’ are distinct real-world states, but they cannot both appear in $\Omega$ since they both map to $\mathsf{True}$. The restriction can be written as:
\[
\forall\,\omega\neq\omega'\in\Omega\ \ \exists\,j\in J:\ R_j(\omega)\neq R_j(\omega').
\]

In a prediction market, there are a set of shares. If we label them and add them all to an index set, that set is $J$. For this example, $J=\{\textsf{YES},\textsf{NO}\}$: Hal Finney is named (yes) and else (no). This is a normal case where each share in $J$ corresponds to an outcome in $\Omega$ but it is possible that the number of shares could exceed the number of outcomes.\footnote{For example, consider a market of where Newcastle United (NUFC) finishes in the 2024-35 English Premier League season. Since there are 20 teams, the outcome has 20 possible labels: positions 1 to 20. Shares could exist for each of the 20 positions. But the outcome could also settle shares for whether NUFC finishes in the top 5 (which is relevant to champions league admittance), or shares on finishing in the bottom 3 (which is relevant to relegation).}

$J$ is the index set of contract labels, the names of the tradeable shares. In this binary market we take $J=\{\textsf{YES},\textsf{NO}\}$. 

The labels get their meaning from the component payoff functions $R_j:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. In this example, a payoff of 1 is given for shares that correctly predict the outcome and 0 otherwise. This means $R_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{True})=1$, $R_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{False})=0$, $R_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{True})=0$, $R_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{False})=1$.

Recall Definition~\ref{def:market} of a prediction--market system $\mathcal{S}=(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N},\mathsf{Res})$:
$\mathcal{M}$ is the (countable) catalog of markets; $\mathcal{N}$ is the numeraire (unit of account used to price and settle claims);
and $\mathsf{Res}=\{\mathrm{res}_M\}_{M\in\mathcal{M}}$ assigns to each market $M$ a resolution register that is initially
$\bot$ and flips exactly once to some $\omega_M\in\Omega_M$.
When $\mathrm{res}_M\neq\bot$, we set $\omega_M:=\mathrm{res}_M$ and each unit of label $j\in J$ settles for $R_j(\omega_M)$ units of $\mathcal{N}$.

This market is a winner--take--all (Arrow--Debreu) special case: there is a bijection $\iota:J\to\Omega$ as follows: $\textsf{YES}\rightarrow\mathsf{True}$ and $\textsf{NO}\rightarrow\mathsf{False}$. Payoffs are $R_j(\omega)=\mathbf{1}\{\omega=\iota(j)\}$. Hence, for each $\omega\in\Omega$, exactly one label pays $1$ and all others pay $0$. 

The market tuple $M=(E,\Omega,J,R)$ specifies \emph{what} to pay \emph{given} an outcome (via $R$).
The register $\mathrm{res}_M$ is the system’s single source of truth for \emph{which} outcome actually occurred:
before resolution $\mathrm{res}_M=\bot$ (no settlement), after resolution $\mathrm{res}_M=\omega_M\in\Omega_M$ (settlement applies).

Polymarket instantiates $\mathcal{S}$ with $\mathcal{M}$ equal to its live and historical markets, $\mathcal{N}$ the USD–denominated stablecoin USDC, and $\mathsf{Res}$ implemented by its on–chain resolution process (e.g., UMA’s optimistic oracle) that writes a single outcome to each $\mathrm{res}_M$.

For the Hal–only binary market, the system maintains a resolution register
$\mathrm{res}_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}\in\{\bot\}\cup\Omega$ with
$\Omega=\{\mathsf{True},\mathsf{False}\}$ (i.e., “yes/no” to the proposition).
The register is initially $\bot$ and, after the platform’s resolution process completes, the oracle writes a single value
$\omega_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}\in\Omega$ to the register.

Set $\omega_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}=\mathsf{True}$ iff the documentary (per stated criteria) identifies \emph{Hal Finney} as Satoshi; otherwise set $\omega_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}=\mathsf{False}$.

Shares are fully collateralized to \$1 in the numeraire $\mathcal{N}$ (USDC): a unit of \textsf{YES} pays $1$\,USDC at $\mathsf{True}$ and $0$\,USDC at $\mathsf{False}$; a unit of \textsf{NO} pays $1$\,USDC at $\mathsf{False}$ and $0$\,USDC at $\mathsf{True}$. Formally,
\[
R_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{True})=1,\ \ R_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{False})=0,\qquad
R_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{True})=0,\ \ R_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{False})=1.
\]

In the aired documentary, \emph{Peter Todd} was named; therefore
\[
\mathrm{res}_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}=\omega_{M_{\mathrm{Hal}}}=\mathsf{False},
\]
and each unit settles as
\[
\textsf{YES}\ \to\ 0\ \text{USDC},\qquad
\textsf{NO}\ \to\ 1\ \text{USDC}.
\]

\subsection{Pass 2: YNB Market}

We define a \textit{family} of markets $\{M_c\}_{c\in C}$ where each $c\in C$ names one market in the family. For the HBO film, $C$ is the set of candidates including $\mathsf{Finney}$, $\mathsf{Szabo}$,  $\mathsf{Sassaman}$,  $\mathsf{Back}$, and $\mathsf{Other/Multiple}$. The event $E_c$ for a particular $\{M_c\}$ is: the documentary identifies $c$ as Satoshi. For each candidate's market, the relevant market outcomes are $\Omega_c=\tuple{\mathsf{True},\mathsf{False}}$. As a YNB market, Polymarket creates a yes share and a no share for each candidate $J_c=\tuple{\textsf{YES},\textsf{NO}}$ called a yes/no bundle (YNB). The payoffs are as follows: $R^{(c)}_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{True})=1$, $R^{(c)}_{\textsf{YES}}(\mathsf{False})=0$, $R^{(c)}_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{True})=0$, and $R^{(c)}_{\textsf{NO}}(\mathsf{False})=1$. Each $\{M_c\}$ has its own volume of outstanding shares, its own pricing, and its own orderbook or AMM. 

For settling, $\mathsf{Res}=\{\mathrm{res}_{M}\}_{M\in\mathcal{M}}$ gives each $M_c$ a register $\mathrm{res}_{M_c}\in\{\bot\}\cup\Omega_c$, initially $\bot$, that flips exactly once to $\omega_{M_c}\in\Omega_c$. The documentary named Peter Todd, who was not one of the named candidates and thus fell under \textsf{Other/Multiple}: $\omega_{M_{\textsf{Other/Multiple}}}=\mathsf{True}$ while $\omega_{M_c}=\mathsf{False}$ for all other $c\neq\textsf{Other/Multiple}$. 

The $R^{(c)}_j(\omega_{M_c})$ for \textsf{Other/Multiple: YES} was $1$ USDC, \textsf{Other/Multiple: NO} was $0$ USDC, every other named candidate’s \textsf{NO} paid $1$ USDC and their corresponding \textsf{YES} paid $0$ USDC. 

% = = = 

\subsection{Axioms}

Polymarket works through \textit{splitting} (see \S\ref{wf:trade}) as follows. Any trader can receive 1 yes share and 1 no share for a specified candidate's market $\{M_c\}$  by depositing 1 USDC into the treasury for the market. When the market resolves, one share will resolve for 1 USDC and one will resolve for 0 USDC. Thus in both cases, Polymarket has exactly the correct amount in the treasury to complete its payout and is solvent. Every split increases the number of shares (yes and no) by 1 share and increase the treasury by 1 USDC. After the market resolves, the winning shares can be redeemed for 1 USDC which decreases the outstanding winning shares by 1 and reduces the treasury by 1 USDC. Shares are fungible as the payout for each share of the same type is identical. Polymarket allows shares to withdrawn as ERC20 tokens and traded using any compatible marketplace. It also provides a CLOB and an AMM for each share.

The HBO documentary market is a special case, called negative risk (NR), in which each candidate's yes/no bundle is a complete set of outcomes (either the candidate is named or the candidate is not named) and additionally the set of yes shares for each candidate is complete (one and only one of the candidates will be declared the winner). Thus it is WTA across each yes/no bundle and it is also WTA across all yes shares.
