Decentralized prediction markets (DePMs) allow open participation in event-based wagering without relying on centralized intermediaries. Despite early designs of Augur and Gnosiss being influential, mass-adoption deployments like Polymarket have departed from canonical blueprints, favouring hybrids and a new framework-based paradigm. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we deconstruct DePMs into a modular workflow comprising seven stages: infrastructure, market specification, claim structure, trade microstructure, resolution, settlement, and archiving. For each module, we enumerate design variants, analyze trade-offs around decentralization, expressiveness, and manipulation resistance, and document emergent patterns in deployed systems. We ground our analysis with examples from leading DePMs, formalize market models, and expose novel concerns, including topic definitional ambiguity, impact of early stage design choices and AI applications in market resolution. Our SoK offers a design palette for DePM builders and a foundation for future research in decentralized forecasting and predictions.
