\section{Introduction}

In late 2024, the United States was in the midst of a presidential election when the decentralized prediction market, Polymarket~\cite{poly}, broke through mainstream news coverage~\cite{Cha24,YBG24a}. Stories focused, in particular, on the fact that it offered odds more favourable to eventual winner Donald Trump than those reflected in conventional polls and forecasts. Polymarket's odds are not set by experts or pundits, instead it is a specific type of betting market where odds are extrapolated from the prices of trades made in an open market (or somewhat open, as Polymarket was banned at the time in many countries including the US). 

As with traditional betting, whether online or through a bookie, prediction markets allow speculators to profit from correct forecasts~\cite{AFGH+08,WoZi06}. However the structure of a prediction market is different than traditional betting. One key difference is that prediction markets ease the process of moving in and out of bets before the event resolves, encouraging traders to place bets if they think the odds are over- or under-stated, and withdrawing profits if the odds realign.

It would be easy to think that Polymarket's design is the most obvious, straight-forward way to deploy a decentralized prediction market (\depm) on a blockchain. However the central thesis of this systemization of knowledge (SoK) paper is that Polymarket found success in bucking the trend. \depms were first given a few paragraphs in the Ethereum vision paper~\cite{But13}, released in late 2013 for the blockchain that would be deployed in 2015. Then two 2014 papers presented flushed out systems: a whitepaper called Truthcoin~\cite{Sz14} and an academic paper at WEIS 2014~\cite{BCFKMN14} (informally known as the `Princeton \depm' because of author affiliation). Developed independently,\footnote{The Princeton paper describes Truthcoin as being released while the paper was under review~\cite{BCFKMN14}, and the Truthcoin FAQ~\cite{Sz14b} mentions hearing about the Princeton paper but not having found the paper itself.} the two papers' designs are vastly different, representing two different goalposts for how a \depm might look. 

Early systems, like Augur~\cite{AKPWZ15} and Gnosis~\cite{Gn17} closely resembled Truthcoin~\cite{Sz14}, while modern systems like Polymarket~\cite{poly} either resemble the Princeton \depm~\cite{BCFKMN14} or use new solutions that resemble a hybrid of the two designs. Consider some examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item From \S\ref{wf:price}, in Truthcoin, the market creator is active in setting initial prices (\ie odds) for each option and risks its own money (bounded)~\cite{Sz14}. In the Princeton system, the market creator is passive, not setting prices or risking any money~\cite{BCFKMN14}. Polymarket uses the latter~\cite{poly}. 

\item From \S\ref{wf:trade}, in Truthcoin, outcome shares are created with predecessor to an automated market maker~\cite{Sz14}. In the Princeton \depm, outcome shares are traded with an orderbook~\cite{BCFKMN14}. In Polymarket, outcome shares can be traded with either an AMM or an orderbook~\cite{poly}. 

\item From \S\ref{wf:close}, in Truthcoin, the blockchain decides event outcomes (\eg who won the election) through a reputation-based on-chain vote with slashing~\cite{Sz14}. In the Princeton paper, they are resolved through trusted arbiters acting as oracles~\cite{BCFKMN14}. The Ethereum whitepaper suggests both~\cite{But13}. In Polymarket, the third party oracle, UMA, operates under the hood through on-chain voting with slashing, but only when outcomes are disputed~\cite{poly,uma}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Research Questions.} Noticing these points of differences inspired us to enumerate all of the design decisions involved in creating a \depm. What are the core modules that appear across DePM designs? How do DePMs differ in how they implement each module (creation, trading, resolution, settlement)? Which early design choices shaped later DePM architectures? Which design choices create recurring failure modes or operational problems? What trade-offs do DePMs make between decentralization, usability, and correctness of resolution? We also ask what open design gaps remain for building robust DePMs (these are marked as `research gaps' in the paper).

\paragraph{Systemization of Knowledge (SoK).} Within the blockchain literature, a variety of SoKs have been published with a variety of methodologies and deliverables, making it difficult to establish what constitutes an SoK paper. We review several SoKs from \textit{FC} and \textit{AFT} that, like us, consider a blockchain technology: oracles~\cite{ClEsGS21}, stablecoins~\cite{MSS20}, DeFi services~\cite{WPG+22}, light clients~\cite{CBC22}, layer 2s~\cite{GMR+20}, privacy technologies~\cite{BCDF23}, and MEV mitigations~\cite{HW22}. Like us, every one of these papers compares/contrasts a set of technologies~\cite{ClEsGS21,MSS20,WPG+22,GMR+20} or theoretical models~\cite{CBC22,BCDF23,HW22} from academia and industry. Like us, the main deliverable is decomposing designs into a taxonomy or classification system for comparison and evaluation~\cite{ClEsGS21,MSS20,WPG+22,GMR+20,CBC22,BCDF23,HW22}. Like us, some distill the technology into a single model into layers or abstractions before classifying~\cite{ClEsGS21}, others offer definitions~\cite{CBC22,WPG+22}. Only one of these papers does quantitative experiments~\cite{WPG+22}, a welcome but unnecessary requirement for SoKs. Unlike a literature review---which primarily summarizes prior work paper-by-paper---an SoK imposes a common set of concepts, abstractions, and evaluation criteria so that disparate systems can be compared on a level playing field rather than merely described.

\paragraph{Methodology.} We obtained a collection of academic works on decentralized prediction markets, as well as various intersecting topics including (centralized) prediction markets, oracles, DeFi, and AMMs. We used our knowledge of the field, Google Scholar (search and cited by features), and citations within papers. Our library is available, sorted by topic, on Zotero.\footnote{Zotero: \textblue{Link withheld for anonymity.}} We also identified projects without white-papers or academic papers, reviewing the 97 current projects listed on a recently released online dashboard~\cite{Sal25} and by studying 20+ historical systems that are no longer active. We also searched news sources for opinions and issues on leading decentralized prediction markets, such as Polymarket. We applied the following exclusion criteria to remove from consideration designs that are: fully permissioned \cepms, alternative wager structures beyond the first notable design we saw (\eg parimutuel betting~\cite{ThZi88,KNZ08,ULSM25}, back/lay exchanges~\cite{CHKL21} and cash for difference contracts~\cite{ACES17}), supporting/adjacent infrastructure, and insufficiently documented or scams. We reviewed over a hundred projects, distilled into the 35+ notable \depms listed in Appendix~\ref{app:list}.

A modular workflow (\cf~\cite{ClEsGS21}) is an abstraction that breaks competing designs into the same common set of steps and parts, enabling side-by-side comparison. We used multiple rounds of affinity diagramming to cluster \depm sub-components from our corpus into eight stages: underlying infrastructure, market topic, share structure and pricing, trading, market resolution, settlement, and archiving.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Wagering Systems}

Consider the following taxonomy of a few wagering systems:

\adjustbox{max width=\textwidth}{
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  font=\footnotesize,
  grow=right,                    % horizontal (left -> right)
  level distance=40mm,           % horizontal gap between levels
  sibling distance=8mm,          % vertical gap between siblings
  box/.style={draw, rounded corners, align=left, inner sep=2pt, text width=28mm}
]
\node{Event wagering}
  child { node{Bookmakers} }
  child { node[]{Prediction markets}
    child { node[]{Centralized (\cepms) } }
    child { node[]{Decentralized (\depms)} }
  };
\end{tikzpicture}
}

\paragraph{Bookmakers versus prediction markets.}

A wager is a two-party contract with payouts based on the outcome of a future event. Consider Alice and Bob who wager on the same outcome of an event. With a fixed-odds bookmaker (or online betting), Alice's contract is different from Bob's contract in at least two regards: (i) it specifically names Alice as the counterparty and (ii) the payouts could be different if the odds changed between Alice's wager and Bob's. By contrast, in a prediction market contract (called a outcome share), Alice and Bob hold identical contracts: (i) all contracts are between the market operator and whoever redeems the contract, and (ii) the payout is exactly the same (typically \$0 if incorrect and \$1 if correct). Odds are reflected in the price paid for a prediction market contract (\ie variable cost and fixed payout), while a bookmaker contract has a fixed cost and variable payout. Thus the key distinction is that prediction market outcome shares are \textit{fungible} and can be freely traded between participants, enabling a free market that communicates information to the public through outcome share prices, trading volume, market depth, and other financial market metrics. Operating a prediction market also differs from operating a bookmaker in a very important way: 

\RQ{Bookmakers quote odds without needing to hold sufficient funds in the event of a payout. It is merely a promise to pay. By contrast, a prediction market is structured with sufficient collateral for all outcomes at all times (including the very first trade! See \S\ref{wf:init}).  Every dollar paid to a winning trader is a dollar from either (a) a losing trader or (b) bounded within a special loss fund setup before the market opens.}

\paragraph{\cepm versus \depm.}

The term \textit{decentralized prediction market} originates from the Ethereum whitepaper~\cite{But13} and we abbreviate it \depm to match terms like DeFi (decentralized finance)~\cite{WPG+22} and DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks)~\cite{LWS+24,MEB+25}. The term \textit{decentralized}~\cite{OKK24} in each of these is actually shorthand for both \textit{decentralized} and \textit{permissionless}, where permissionlessness is generally the more important way \depms distinguish themselves from centralized prediction markets (\cepms). Permissionlessness could extend itself to the market topic, the trading of outcome shares, the closing of the market, and the withdrawing of rewards, but not all systems will open up each of these operations (as we will explain in \S\ref{sec:wf}). We say a system is \depm if at least one is permissionless.

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:defn}

We start with an abstract definition of a prediction market. Our definition generalizes on recent computer science-based definitions~\cite{BMR17,FPW23,SGKS25} which each presume specific sub-types of a prediction market (\eg \cite{BMR17,SGKS25} use \textit{merging/splitting} while \cite{FPW23} presumes \textit{automated bookmaking} from \S\ref{wf:trade}). %If our definitions are not clear, we refer the reader to Appendix~\ref{app:example} where we describe a specific market offered by Polymarket and map each part of definitions to this real world example.

We now turn to the design landscape of \depms and step through our modular workflow (\cf~\cite{ClEsGS21}) of eight stages: underlying infrastructure, market topic, share structure and pricing, trading, market resolution, settlement, and archiving. For each stage, we enumerate the possible designs and discuss competing trade-offs, summarized as the columns of Table~\ref{tab:class}. %Some design decisions will be common issues for both centralized and decentralized prediction markets. We include these anyways for completeness. However we put the emphasis on discussing design decisions that are pertinent to decentralization and permissionlessness. 

\gap{Can accuracy metrics~\cite{GN07} be used to compare various \cepm and \depm platforms? Are there meaningful correlations between accuracy and the market microstructure options in Table~\ref{tab:class}?}

\subsection{Underlying Infrastructure}
\label{subsec:blockchain_infra}\label{wf:chain}

Due to page restrictions, we relegate the designs for the underlying infrastructure to Appendix~\ref{app:chain}. It describes various blockchain options and notes that the transparency of a blockchain can lead to copy-trading, posing a research gap related to that.

\subsection{Market Topic}\label{wf:topic}

Due to page restrictions, we relegate the designs for the market topic to Appendix~\ref{app:topic}. It describes the differences between permissioned and permissionless systems for setting up what the market is about. Permissioned topic selection requires a central party, while permissionless designs can have problems with unethical markets (\eg assassination markets), spam, fragmentation, and poorly defined topics. The appendix also provides important real-world examples of ill-defined market topics that have proven to be problematic. It provides an insight and a research gap related to these points.

\subsection{Share Structure and Pricing}\label{wf:mech}\label{wf:price}

The core requirement of a prediction market is that wagers are represented by fungible outcome shares. The structure of outcome shares typically falls into one of three categories and two variants (although more exotic structures are possible and explored in research). 

\subsubsection{WTA.}

The first structure we term \textit{winner-take-all (WTA)} (\aka \textit{categorical}) and was popularized by Iowa Electronic Markets~\cite{iem}. Consider a market with three possible outcomes: $\Omega=\{\mathsf{A}, \mathsf{B}, \mathsf{C}\}$.  A WTA market issues an outcome share for each outcome $J=\{j_\mathsf{A}, j_\mathsf{B}, j_\mathsf{C}\}$. If there are only two outcomes, it is called a \textit{binary market}. If the outcome $\omega$ is $\mathsf{B}$, the share $j_\mathsf{B}$ pays \$1 (or one unit of numeraire $\mathcal{N}$) and the other shares pay \$0.  For any $k\in\{\mathsf{A},\mathsf{B},\mathsf{C}\}$,

\begin{equation}
R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k}}}=\begin{cases}1, & \text{if } \omega=\mathsf{k},\\0, & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}
\end{equation}

For a WTA market to be well-functioning, two conditions must hold on outcome shares. (i) They should be \textit{mutually exclusive} so no more than one share wins: $R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k}}}\,R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{\ell}}}=0 \quad \forall\omega\in\Omega, \forall\mathsf{k}\neq\mathsf{\ell} $; and (ii) they should be \textit{complete} so at least one share wins: $\sum_{\mathsf{k}\in\Omega} R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k}}}=1\quad \forall \omega\in\Omega$. If they are not mutually exclusive, the operator could be under-collateralized for making all payments (in violation of solvency in Definition~\ref{def:axioms}). If they are incomplete, a deficient market might end with all participants receiving \$0. A consequence is that holding one share for each outcome is equivalent to holding \$1, a fact we will return to in \S\ref{wf:trade}. 

In a WTA market, the price of a outcome share (\eg $p(j_\mathsf{A})=\$0.54$) is a proxy for the probability that the outcome will occur (\eg $\mathrm{Pr}[\omega=\mathsf{A}]=54\%$). A common adage is the prices of each share sum to \$1.00 ignoring fees and discounting (\eg $p(j_\mathsf{A})=\$0.54$, $p(j_\mathsf{B})=\$0.23$, $p(j_\mathsf{C})=\$0.23$) but this is imprecise~\cite{BCFKMN14}. Outcome shares (like anything) have two prices: a bid price (what a trader is willing to buy for) and an ask price (willing to sell for). If the sum of the bid prices exceeds \$1.00 or if the sum of ask prices are below \$1.00, arbitrageurs have an opportunity to secure risk-free profit through a trade that will erase the condition when fully extracted. This means the sum of bids and sum of asks should result in the bid-ask spread straddling \$1.00 but the amount of the spread could be arbitrarily large. So in user interfaces that display a single `price' (\eg the last sale price or the midpoint between the best bid and the best ask), prices may indeed not sum to \$1.00---this is not a market failure, just a misunderstanding. 

 % = = =
 
 \subsubsection{YNB.}
 
The second structure we term a \textit{yes-no bundle (YNB)}. YNB markets were popularized by InTrade~\cite{intrade}. A YNB market issues two share labels for each outcome, a `yes' and a `no:'  $J=\{j_{\mathsf{A_Y}}, j_{\mathsf{A_N}}, j_{\mathsf{B_Y}}, j_{\mathsf{B_N}}, j_{\mathsf{C_Y}},j_{\mathsf{C_N}} \}$. For any $k\in\{\mathsf{A},\mathsf{B},\mathsf{C}\}$,

\begin{equation}
R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k_Y}}}=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \omega=\mathsf{k},\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\qquad
R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k_N}}}=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \omega\neq\mathsf{k},\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Each outcome-specific pair $\{j_{\mathsf{k_Y}}, j_{\mathsf{k_N}}\}$ constitutes a binary WTA market ($\mathsf{k}$ vs.\ not-$\mathsf{k}$). A YNB market is the union of these pairs, so the WTA exclusivity and completeness properties hold per pair. However exclusivity and completeness do not necessarily hold across all bundles, allowing more flexible markets. For example, a market on what words Trump will say in a congressional address included Bitcoin (no), beautiful at least 10 times (yes), and Canada (yes).\footnote{\polyurl{What will Trump say during address to Congress?}{https://polymarket.com/event/what-will-trump-say-during-state-of-the-union?tid=1755462445353}} Multiple words can resolve to yes (not exclusive) and it is possible he says none of the listed words (not complete). An established YNB market that is being actively traded, because it is not complete, can have new outcomes added to it fairly, whereas WTA markets must account for every possible outcome at the start of the market (perhaps utilizing an `other' outcome).

\subsubsection{YNB-NR.}

A variant of the YNB market is one where, even though it is not necessary, the yes share outcomes are in fact complete and exclusive. In other words, each yes/no bundle is a WTA market and the set of all yes shares is also a WTA market. We term this YNB variant as \textit{negative risk} (YNB-NR), a term introduced by Polymarket~\cite{poly}. Recall that in a WTA market, roughly speaking, the share prices sum to \$1 (modulo the fine print about bid/ask spreads above). For a YNB-NR market, the Yes shares sum to \$1, while the No shares will sum to $|\Omega|-1$.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mathsf{k}\in\Omega} R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k_Y}}}=1
\quad\text{and}\quad
\sum_{\mathsf{k}\in\Omega} R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k_N}}}=|\Omega|-1
\quad\text{for all }\omega\in\Omega.
\end{equation}

The HBO documentary market from Section~\ref{sec:hbo} is an example of a YNB-NR market (Polymarket markets are either YNB or YNB-NR\footnote{Dune Analytics: `\href{https://dune.com/filarm/polymarket-activity}{Polymarket - Activity and Volume}' compares YNB (called CTF there) and YNB-NR (called negrisk there) statistics.}). This market was intended to be exclusive and complete across bundles by including a bundle for the outcome: `other/multiple.' Holding a No outcome share for Hal Finney has the same payoff as holding a Yes share for every other candidate. Polymarket introduced a \textit{negRisk} gadget that allows a trader to convert any No share into a portfolio of Yes shares for every other outcome. This enables traders to adjust their positions with less buying/selling on the markets, and also aligns prices between Yes and No markets with low friction arbitrage opportunities. Formally, a single No share has the equivalence (\ie same payoff ignoring fees and discounting):

\begin{equation}
R(\omega)_{j_{\mathsf{k_N}}} \;=\; \sum_{\ell \in \Omega\setminus\{\mathsf{k}\}} R(\omega)_{j_{\ell_Y}}
\quad\text{for all }\omega\in\Omega\text{ and any }\mathsf{k}\in\Omega.
\end{equation}

While Yes has equivalence to:

\begin{equation}
R(\omega)_{j_{k_Y}}
\;=\;
\sum_{\ell\in\Omega\setminus\{k\}} R(\omega)_{j_{\ell_N}}
\;-\;
(|\Omega|-2)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Scalar.} A third structure is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:scalar}. It is not frequently used. 

\gap{How does a \textit{negRisk} gadget encourage price parity between equivalent positions? Can we quantify its improvements for price execution and trade execution costs? Does a reverse gadget, for converting a single yes share, offer similar benefits?}

\gap{The academic literature has explored advanced market types, including combinatorial markets and establishing conditional probabilities from markets. Implementing and experimenting with these designs for \depms is open. In sports-betting, chaining together multiple outcomes in an all-or-nothing bet (parlay) is popular but a treatment for \depms is lacking. }

\subsection{Market Initialization}\label{wf:init}
% JC

Options for trading outcome shares can be broken into two steps: (i) how does the first outcome share come into existence and how does the first trader trade, and (ii) how do traders trade once a market has been established? Probably the greatest evolution in \depms, from Truthcoin to Polymarket, concerns how the first trade happens. There are three options: \textit{automated bookmaking}, \textit{splitting}, and \textit{matching}. 

\textit{Automated bookmaking} was popularized through the academic work of Robin Hanson~\cite{Ha03,Han07b}, researched for Intrade~\cite{McC08}, and first suggested for \depms by Truthcoin~\cite{Sz14}, which heavily influenced Augur v1~\cite{AKPWZ15}. 

\begin{definition}[Automated bookmaking]\label{def:autobook}
Fix a market $M=(\Omega,J,R)$. An \emph{automated bookmaker} posts (i) a loss fund $\mathsf{Treas}\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ in the numeraire $\mathcal{N}$ and (ii) a pricing rule (odds) for labels $j\in J$. It accepts deposits in $\mathcal{N}$ and issues shares, updating the supply vector $S$, and must always satisfy solvency (Definition~\ref{def:axioms}). 
\end{definition}

In this model, the operator sets initial prices for each outcome share (equivalent to setting market odds) and collateralizes enough payout money to cover a worst-case loss in its treasury. If Alice is the first trader, she can immediately trade with the operator. The operator is autonomous and sets buy/sell prices algorithmically, originally using Hanson's logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR)~\cite{Han07b}. The key point is that the operator's fund is Alice's counterparty; if Alice wins, the fund loses, and vice-versa. The pros are instant liquidity for the first trader and the cons are the risk to the operator of losing money and the burden of needing to set initial odds (getting them wrong increases the chances it loses). 

Acute readers might wonder the relationship between automated bookmaking and  an automated market makers (\eg Uniswap), which are discussed in the next section. Roughly speaking, a WTA market run by automated bookmaking is termed a cost-function prediction market (CFPM) and a CFPM is equivalent in pricing (and trade costs) to an AMM (defined by a set of axioms) with the right invariant~\cite{FPW23}.

The second approach, \textit{splitting}, was first suggested for \depms by the Princeton \depm~\cite{BCFKMN14} based on the Iowa Electronic Market~\cite{iem}. Augur switched from automated book making to splitting in v2~\cite{AKPWZ19}, Gnosis implemented splitting in CTF~\cite{ctf}, and \depms built on CTF, including Polymarket~\cite{poly} and Omen~\cite{Omen_docs}, use it.

\begin{definition}[Splitting and merging]\label{def:splitmerge}
Fix a market $M=(\Omega,J,R)$ in numeraire $\mathcal{N}$. A \emph{splitting/merging} mechanism provides counterparty-free state transitions for a fixed \emph{unit bundle} $B$ of WTA share labels such that
\[
\sum_{j\in B} R(\omega)_j = 1 \quad\text{for all }\omega\in\Omega.
\]
\emph{Splitting} maps $1\cdot\mathcal{N}\mapsto \sum_{j\in B} j$ (minting one unit of each $j\in B$), and \emph{merging} maps $\sum_{j\in B} j \mapsto 1\cdot\mathcal{N}$ (burning them), typically before resolution. Repeating the operation yields multiple bundles.
\end{definition}

Recall that in a WTA market, exactly one share in a set of shares will payout \$1. This means that holding a complete portfolio of every share is equivalent (in payoff, ignoring fees and discounting) to holding \$1. A splitting gadget allows a trader to input \$1 and receive a portfolio contain 1 share of each outcome. Generally, a \textit{merging} gadget is also available where a complete set can be redeemed for \$1 at any time before the market closes. Alice can obtain a set of shares and list asking prices (through a limit order book or by being the first liquidity provider in an AMM) for some or all of the shares, and if Bob is willing to buy a share from Alice, the first trade occurs. The pros to splitting is that the operator has zero exposure to the market, while the con is that Alice must wait for a second trader, Bob, before she can trade. 

In YNB markets, each outcome’s YES/NO pair is its own two-outcome WTA market. Splitting is per outcome: converting \$1 of collateral mints one $j_{\mathsf{k_Y}}$ and one $j_{\mathsf{k_N}}$ for the chosen $\mathsf{k}$. Across outcomes, supplies are uncoupled---the total minted for the outcome $\mathsf{A}$'s bundle need not match that for outcomes $\mathsf{B}$ or $\mathsf{C}$. 

\RQ{If the first trader makes one dollar, someone must lose a dollar. It either needs to be the operator or a second trader. This forces \depms to choose between needing a loss fund or having no instant liquidity for the first trader.}

The third approach, \textit{matching}, was used by InTrade~\cite{intrade} and a variant by Fairlay~\cite{fairlay}, and is used today by Kalshi. We provide a description and research insight in Appendix~\ref{app:matching}.

\subsection{Trading}\label{wf:trade}

Once outcome shares are in circulation, they can be traded any way fungible blockchain tokens can be traded. This includes \textit{centralized exchanges} that custody the tokens and use central order book (CLOBs); \textit{partially decentralized exchanges} where CLOB matching is done off-chain and settlement is done on-chain; or \textit{fully on-chain exchanges}, of which automated market makers (AMMs) are the most common. 

Of interest, AMMs were born out of Gnosis' research into automated bookmarking for prediction markets. They first developed alternatives to the LMSR rule, including the constant product rule~\cite{LK17}. In parallel, Bancor worked on exchanges where multiple traders could contribute tokens to a common liquidity pool. Uniswap v1 merged these two ideas to create the basic template of an AMM that is common today.

Circling back to automated bookmaking, splitting can be used in conjunction with AMMs to realize automated booking, as first used in Gnosis' closed beta Sight~\cite{Bar19}. An operator begins with $2n$ units of the numeraire, \eg $2n$ USDC. It takes half of the money, $n$ USDC, and uses the splitting gadget to obtain $n$ shares in each outcome. For each outcome share, it estimates the outcome probability as $p_i$ and starts an AMM with initial liquidity of $n$ outcome shares and $p_i\cdot n$ USDC. It repeats for each outcome. Thus assuming the probabilities sum to 1, the operator has split its remaining $n$ USDC across the AMMs. The operator can lose up to $2n$ USDC in divergence loss, assuming traders can split as well (and thus create the shares necessary to drain the AMM of its USDC), in addition to failing (through stale prices) to realize profits (\ie LVR~\cite{MMRZ22}). The important point is that the operator is still solvent per Definition~\ref{def:axioms} as the $2n$ USDC is either locked in the splitting gadget or locked in the AMM.

Despite the direct lineage between prediction markets and AMMs, AMMs are problematic for prediction market trading. \depm outcome shares behave in specific ways that differ from typical crypto-assets and tokens. The price is strictly bounded between \$0 and \$1, the value of a share can jump to \$0 or \$1 near-instantly when an event outcome is finalized, and once finalized, the price is permanent. When real world events occur, AMMs can be drained faster than liquidity providers can withdraw liquidity. 

\gap{Adapting AMMs to the unique constraints of predictions markets is at an early stage. Paradigm’s pm-AMM tapers liquidity as a scheduled expiry approaches, which helps for events that crystallize over a fixed time horizon~\cite{MR24}; but many markets jump or resolve unexpectedly, falling outside of the model used for the results.}

When trading on-chain, miners and other users can front-run transactions, an area of study called maximum extracted value (MEV)~\cite{BBDGJKLZ19}. Although the term MEV did not exist at the time, the Princeton \depm describes the MEV problem extensively~\cite{BCFKMN14} and proposes a mitigation now called a frequent batch auction (FBA) (again, the term FBA was not popularized until later~\cite{BCS15}).

\gap{Can we measurement  MEV extraction for on-chain \depms? What mechanisms for order-flow privacy apply to on-chain \depms?}

A final trading-relevant subject for prediction markets is arbitrage. Arbitrageurs ensure market prices are consistent, for example across all shares in a WTA market or between Yes/No bundles in a YNB market. A recent paper studies combinatorial arbitrage on Polymarket between markets with logically related predicates (\eg Republicans win the presidency; Trump wins the presidency) and measures roughly \$40M USD of realized arbitrage profits over the measurement period~\cite{SGKS25}.

\subsection{Market Resolution}\label{wf:close}

Market resolution approaches specify how a DePM determines and finalizes the winning outcome and triggers settlement. Designs vary in where the ground truth comes from (market prices, external sources, or participants), who can influence the decision, and what incentives/penalties secure it. In this section we review: 
 oracle-less designs (on-chain truth, self-settling markets, auto-resolve rules), using a designated arbiter, using a network of reporters, and crowdsourcing a vote. The term \textit{oracle} is commonly used for any of the latter three approaches.  

\subsubsection{Oracle-less.}

A market topic might reference \textit{on-chain truth} (\eg total value locked in a DeFi service at the end of the year) in which case resolution can be made directly. A \textit{self-settling market}~\cite{BMR17} works with \textit{splitting} and \textit{merging} (see \S\ref{wf:trade}) of shares; it relies on participants with winning shares to purchase the losing shares (for close to \$0) and redeem \$1 by merging them. If losing shares do not trade near \$0 or become illiquid, the broader market might accept winning shares as a substitute for dollars. If a market outcome is contentious with no recognized winner (\eg a poorly defined market in \S\ref{wf:topic}), the market will not settle. An \textit{auto-resolve rule} could also be used such that outcomes are finalized when, say, their token trades above \$0.99 for at least $t$ time. Auto-resolve rules are subject to market manipulation (losing shares are wash traded near \$1 long enough to finalize, in which case they are worth \$1) or griefing attacks (yes shares are traded below \$0.99 to prevent finalization). While an auto-resolve rule is too fragile to rely on solely, it could be used optimistically to provide an initial settlement; only disputed cases would be escalated to an oracle~\cite{Aug15}. 

\subsubsection{Designated arbiters.}

Typically a \cepm will decide events within the platform~\cite{kalshi}. A \depm might outsource decisions to a trusted organization, such as the Associate Press (AP) which experimented with writing US election results into Ethereum.\footnote{Etherscan: \url{https://etherscan.io/address/0x0792724900B551d200D954a5Ed709d9514d73A9F}} From a trust perspective, this is equivalent to using an AP \cepm, but from a logistics perspective, it is simpler to AP to be an oracle than to run an entire \cepm. Further, it allows \textit{trust agility} where AP can be replaced by a competing source with minimal disruption~\cite{BCFKMN14}. A \depm might also used a designated party only as a last resort if other methods lead to a contentious result~\cite{Rey24}. 

Recently interest is in evaluating arbitration through an AI system~\cite{chaos}. A 2025 Chainlink study poses 1,660 Polymarket questions to LLMs and reports ~89.3\% accuracy (sports 99.7\%, politics 84.3\%)  with temporal-reasoning challenges~\cite{ZVW25}. AI can also be used in agent-mode, tasked with actively gathering evidence and reporting if resolution can be reached~\cite{chaos}. AI oracles are potentially vulnerable to adversarial manipulation and poisoning attacks~\cite{ZGWJ25}, and may recall incorrect facts that are incorrectly stated in the training data. An over-reliance on AI systems in generating news, trading in markets based on news, and settling markets based on news could result in bad interactions or negative feedback loops. 

\subsubsection{Reporter networks.}

Some oracle systems focus on quickly reporting on updating values~\cite{BCCJM21}, such as an asset price or a sports score which could naturally settle some types of prediction markets, such as rapid markets from Augur Turbo~\cite{aug25} and Polymarket~\cite{polylink}. Generally a set (or network) of arbiters (or reporters) will report the value and an aggregation method (\eg median value or a mean value after outlier filtering for quantitative data, mode for qualitative) will update the value on-chain~\cite{ClEsGS21}. Updates are emitted when deviation or heartbeat thresholds are met, giving explicit control over latency/recency and bounding staleness under network stress. A \depm can read the aggregator at a fixed resolution time and settle without discretionary intervention~\cite{aug25,thalesmarket_docs}. 

\subsubsection{Crowdsourced vote.}

A final mechanism is to determine off-chain facts by polling a set of willing participants~\cite{But13,Sz14,AKPWZ15,AKPWZ19,uma,kleros}. This procedure is defined by four design choices:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Electorate}: participants stake governance tokens to enrol and votes are either held with all participants, or with a randomly selected subset of all participants.
\item \textit{Ballots:} may be visible to other participants or may be hidden until voting closes (typically with a two-round commit-reveal protocol but more sophisticated methods could be used~\cite{GSZB23}).
\item \textit{Aggregation:} votes are weighed by the amount of staked tokens, categorical questions are decided by plurality (perhaps with minimum quorum) while quantities with a median or smoothed mean. 
\item \textit{Incentives:} participants who affirmed the final result in their individual votes receive rewards, while those who did not will at least forgo rewards, but might also have their participation tokens slashed. 
\end{enumerate}

The precise parameters of these systems vary significantly across many different designs, while deployed systems like UMA's data verification mechanism (DMV)~\cite{uma} and Kleros~\cite{kleros} have settled billions of dollars. Topics like fee mechanisms and proof of stake consensus protocols have received much academic attention, but incentive-compatible designs and formal proofs for oracles is largely under-explored. By contrast, a growing theoretical line proposes truth-elicitation schemes with formal guarantees~\cite{Pre04,SKC25}. However in practice, uptake is absent, in part because these designs are complex to run, sensitive to Sybil attacks, and can fail if voters rely on a common source of information.

Token votes for \depms are hostile environments where an attacker’s external payoff from a wrong resolution exceeds the system’s economic security, which can lead to failure~\cite{FoBo19}. Rational voters are incentivized to agree with the majority, rather than necessarily reporting the ground truth (a situation colloquially known among economists as a Keynesian beauty contest). The system often works because the ground truth is an obvious point where participants will coordinate (known as a Schelling point), however voters might fear voting for truth if large token holders (whales) visibly stake on a wrong outcome early in the vote. An example\footnote{\polyurl{Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?}{https://polymarket.com/event/ukraine-agrees-to-give-trump-rare-earth-metals-before-april}} occurred on Polymarket~\cite{Rey25}, leading to concerns of token concentration within the UMA token. At the time of writing, the top five UMA wallets UMA control ~45.6\% of votes and the top 13 exceed 65\%, enough to meet the passing threshold.\footnote{Dune Analytics: \href{https://dune.com/uma\_protocol/uma-protocol}{\$UMA Voting Participation}} If successful attacks depress token prices, the attacks become cheaper, potentially creating a spiral (\cf~\cite{KM21}). 

These concerns affirm design decisions like a secret ballot, using subsets of participants in a vote (potentially split by subject expertise), and redrawing larger panels on appeal with higher bonds/fees to raise capture costs only when disputes persist.

\gap{Deciding market outcomes is a uniquely \depm problem (since a \cepm can arbitrate its own markets). Can we bring a theoretical lens to deployed oracle voting systems and understand what formal guarantees about incentives and safety can be made?}

A \depm will probably use a \textit{hybrid} or \textit{chained approach} that does not rely on a single method. For example, an arbiter from an allowlist might be able to propose a market outcome while also allowing disputes from anyone. If an outcome is disputed, it is escalated to a crowdsourced vote. If the vote is considered defective, a further escalation could allow an Admin account to overrule the decision. The ultimate backstop is the law which would not stop a wrong outcome but could be used to remunerate parties damaged by it.

\subsection{Settlement}\label{wf:clear}

Once the market is resolved, a \depm will enable each winning share to be converted into 1 unit of the numeraire (\eg 1 USD in a stablecoin) and transferred into the user's self-custody. While a \depm in theory could \textit{push} payouts to users, it is common to wait for the user to initiate the redemption---a \textit{pull} mechanism~\cite{ctf}. In this case, users pay the gas cost of the redemption which requires users to hold the native currency of the underlying blockchain. Polymarket offers gasless withdrawals (using OpenGSN relayers~\cite{gsn}), however users can bypass this at their choice. In a pull model, some users may not redeem their shares in a timely manner---a \depm may opt to sweep this surplus into its own capital or burn it, but \depms generally hold it on-chain in perpetuity. As with any smart contract allowing withdraws based account balances, hardening against reentrancy attacks is critical.

The slogan `sweat the game, not the payout~\cite{Fu24}' is used to differentiate regulated sportsbook operators from `neighbourhood bookies,' however even legitimate operators in the US have allegedly denied payouts using a legal loophole.\footnote{A law protects sports books from obvious errors, like a `fat finger' when setting odds, but can be misused to claim long-shot bets were `obvious mistakes' after the fact~\cite{Fu24}.} The advantage of a \depm in this context is two-fold: (i) payouts are fully (or largely) autonomous, not subject to human discretion, and (ii) the share structure ensures the operator has zero risk (or predetermined bounded risk, in the case of automated bookmaking) and is therefore financially indifferent to making any fair payout (see the solvency axiom in Definition~\ref{def:axioms}). 

% \textblue{and you can see it.}

\RQ{A prediction market has no need to fight against paying out a bet the way bookmakers have in practice~\cite{Fu24}. When operations are on-chain, solvency can be demonstrated directly from blockchain data.}

\subsection{Archiving}\label{wf:archive}

Due to page restrictions, we relegate the designs for archiving markets to Appendix~\ref{app:archive}. It describes how a market can be reconstructed after the fact, through a mix of on-chain data and off-chain data collected by the operator and possibly offered through APIs. It also presents a research gap related to this.

%\section{Discussion and Research Agenda}

%\paragraph{Composability.} Perhaps the biggest evolution in \depm design is infrastructure~\cite{Gun24}. Early \depms were monolithic, single-vendor codebases. Modern \depms are built from existing infrastructure, which composes through highly standardized interfaces. For example, Polymarket's core \depm code is Gnosis' conditional token framework~\cite{ctf}. The numeraire is Circle's USDC stablecoin, which can be bought with a credit card through MoonPay. Trading outcome shares and USDC works out-of-the-box on any platform (on- or off-chain) that supports ERC-1155 tokens. Market outcome disputes are escalated to UMA's DVM oracle~\cite{uma}. Polymarket also uses third party services for bridging assets, embedded wallets (based on email verification), and EIP-3009 gasless withdrawals. Beyond software engineering benefits, building a service by composing modules can enhance trust agility, which is the ability to quickly swap out modules that are faulty or malicious. For example, Polymarket could switch from UMA to say Chainlink or Kleros, with less effort than if the oracle service was vertically integrated. 


%\paragraph{Regulation.} In jurisdictions like the United States, both \cepms and \depms are tightly controlled and not always legal to operate~\cite{Du19,Ma24}. The paramount concerns of regulators are not specific to prediction markets or the difference in their microstructure from other forms of wagering (although market integrity is always a concern); rather, regulators control any kind of wagering on political events (a stance challenged by leading economists~\cite{AFGH+08}), as well as any kind of financial service offered to unaccredited consumers. For advocates of liberal markets, \depms are seen as a way to side-step regulation, particularly when the \depm is decentralized in most or all dimensions of our taxonomy. 


% Does polymarket need uma?
% Optimistic works - who has time ? 
% Discussion Points:
% Recursive markets (market topic is about another market)
% Insurance / hedging 
% Futurarchy
% Insider trading, asymmetric info, example: betting on software delays -> no surprises any more if PMs extract insider info and build it into prices
% Polymarket as news source (also circular feedback through LLMs, AI trained on market data, AI agents, AI generated news, AI oracles)

%\paragraph{Research Agenda.}

%The history of \depm shows a convergence toward trading outcome shares, creating by splitting, on CLOBs and AMMs. While many aspects of prediction markets have been studied formally, comparing different market microstructures has not received adequate research; and optimizing AMMs for \depms is still at the beginning stages~\cite{KS23,MR24}. Less convergence exists on how to decide market outcomes, a uniquely \depm problem (since a \cepm can arbitrate its own markets). Another way to look for research problems is to pinpoint where faulty behaviour is still occurring: for Polymarket, the biggest sources are poorly defined market topics and the vulnerability of market resolution to manipulation. Analysis of new approaches to either problem (formal verification for topics? AI as oracles?) would be welcome research, as would bringing a theoretical lens to deployed oracle voting systems to understand if formal guarantees about incentives can be made. A lesser known issue is archiving \depm data and developing tools that could fully `replay' a market at each timestep, which would be useful for understanding how markets incorporate news (real and fake) into prices. Finally, the degree to which \depms can be pushed further toward permissionlessness in all aspects is still largely open, particularly around setting topics for markets.

\section{Conclusion}

Researchers and builders have used a set of shifting designs, definitions, and vocabulary for \depms. We aim to provide a modular framework that is useful for careful comparison between systems with different design choices, showcasing the full set of choices available, uncovering unsolved research problems, understanding the history of \depm ideas, and providing a learning resource for those wanting to catch up on \depms. Our taxonomy does not identify a single best design but helps illustrate the trade-offs between them.
